# Basic Cryptography

This is a fun and simple project that shows you how to make secret messages using a basic type of code called the Caesar Cipher. In this project, I wrote a Python script that takes a normal message (like "HELLO") and “shifts” each letter by a fixed number. When you run the script, it changes the letters and gives you an encrypted version (for example, with a shift of 3, “HELLO” becomes “KHOOR”). It can also change the secret message back to the original message. 
## What Does It Do?

**Encrypts Messages:** It turns a normal message into a secret code.
  
**Decrypts Messages:** It can change the secret code back to the normal message.
  
**Teaches You How Ciphers Work:** Learn the basics of how text can be scrambled to hide its meaning.

## How It Works

The script reads your message.
For each letter in the message, it moves that letter a few spots forward in the alphabet (this number is called the “shift”).

The new message is printed out as the encrypted text.
You can change the amount of the shift to experiment with different codes.

## How to Use This Project

**Clone the Repository:**  

Open your terminal (or use a GitHub app) and run:
   git clone https://github.com/chinomsochukwunomso1/caesar-cipher-tool.git
   
**Go to the Project Folder:**  
Change the directory to where the project is saved:

cd Basic Cryptography

**Run the Script:**  
If you have Python installed, run the script with:

python caesar_cipher.py

**Try It Out:**  
Enter a message and a shift number. Watch as the letters change into a secret code!

## What You Will Learn
- **Basic Python Programming:** Understanding how to write and run a simple Python script.
- **Encryption Basics:** Learning how simple math (shifting letters) can create secret messages.
- **Problem Solving:** Experimenting with different shift values and messages.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.x is recommended)
- A simple text editor (or code editor) to view and edit the script
- (Optional) The Pythonista app if you want to run it on your iPad
